A simple file mover that moves a file or files from one directory to
another. To use enter the path to the directory (src) containing the files 
you want to move and the destination path to move the files to. 

The src and destination path must exists but to create a new
folder for the destination enter a name for the new folder and the
script will create a folder by that name if the folder is not found
in the destination directory path.



Todo
Later I will add a web user interface to make it more interactive.
